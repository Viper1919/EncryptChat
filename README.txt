This was a projects focused on a little game I have with my friends. The point of the game is where we need to find ways to hack each other. Like a real life CTF Cchallange. the point of this Project it self, is so that we can converse while also allowing a possible vulnerability.  


While the RSA implementation is not added into this rep (to maintain the fairness of the game), the rest of the chat, and server are.
